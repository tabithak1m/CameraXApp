# MakeUofT-Selfie-Paradox-

## Inspiration
Given the prompt "useless invention", we made our best attempt to develop the most useless device; something that defeats the whole purpose. With the hardware materials given, we were able to come to our current design: the "Selfie Paradox". 

## What it does
As explicit from the name, we built a selfie stick that zooms in the further you stretch the stick. As the purpose of a selfie stick is to include a wider range to capture, zooming in and essentially keeping the frame the same is the useless feature we worked on. 

## How we built it
We incorporated the ultrasound sensor connected to an arduino board, using bluetooth to retrieve the distance to the target object with the HDK8450 device’s processor to build a straightforward and user-friendly camera app that will vary the zoom feature accordingly. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were not able to connect the HDK8450 device to the Arduino board via bluetooth, not being able to input the distance sensed by the ultrasound sensor to alter the zoom ratio as wished.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the camera app that we build from scratch that puts the Snapdragon 8450 processor into use — not a common experience.
We are proud of being able to explore various fields of hardware tools as well as software development and incorporating them all together.
We are proud of building a physical prototype that perfectly demonstrated what we had in mind which gave us full hope that the finalization of the project is feasible.

## What we learned
We learnt the basics of Android development (full stack) as well as how to incorporate various hardware tools.

## What's next for Selfie Paradox
We would like to further develop the bluetooth connection between the two main components — HDK device and Arduino with sensor —  in order to finalize the product with full functionality.
